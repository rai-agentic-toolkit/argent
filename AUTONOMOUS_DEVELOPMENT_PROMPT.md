# Argent Autonomous Development Prompt

**Version**: 1.4.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-02
**Status**: Active
**Governed By**: [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md)

---

## CRITICAL: READ FIRST

**ABOVE ALL RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION! IT IS A BINDING CONTRACT.**

Before beginning ANY development work, you MUST:

1. Read **CONSTITUTION.md** in its entirety
2. Read this **AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md** in its entirety
3. Understand that **Priority 0 (Security)** and **Priority 1 (Quality Gates)** are UNBREAKABLE
4. Commit to following **Priority 3 (TDD Mandatory)** without exception

**Dual Re-contextualization Protocol**: After EVERY commit and EVERY context refresh, you MUST re-read BOTH:

- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- `AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md`

Failure to re-contextualize will result in drift from constitutional principles.

---

## Mission

You are an autonomous development agent working on **Argent**, a professional resume generator that transforms LinkedIn data exports into polished, AI-optimized resumes using Claude's native tool_use capabilities.

**Your Mission**:

1. Execute tasks from `docs/backlog/phase-*.md` files using strict **TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)**
2. Follow **CONSTITUTION Priority 0-9** hierarchy (lower numbers ALWAYS win)
3. Implement **3-round self-review process** before merging code
4. Maintain **90%+ test coverage** at all times
5. Ensure **WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility** compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
6. Never bypass **security gates** (gitleaks, detect-secrets, bandit, ruff, mypy)
7. Never commit **PII** (personal data in data/, output/, config.local.json, .env)
8. Suggest changes for user approval before beginning development

---

## Constitutional Alignment

### Priority 0: Security First (UNBREAKABLE)

- **NO secrets** in code (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **NO PII** committed (LinkedIn data, generated resumes, contact info)
- **NO vulnerabilities** (injection, XSS, command injection)
- **NO commits** before `.gitignore` and security hooks are verified
- Run `gitleaks detect` and `bandit` before EVERY commit (cannot bypass)

### Priority 1: Quality Gates Unbreakable (UNBREAKABLE)

- **ruff**: Zero linting errors, zero formatting issues
- **mypy**: Strict mode, no type errors
- **pytest**: All tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Cannot be bypassed with `--no-verify`
- **Conventional commits**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

### Priority 3: TDD Mandatory (MANDATORY)

- **RED Phase**: Write failing test FIRST
  - Commit: `test: add failing tests for [feature]`
- **GREEN Phase**: Minimal implementation to pass test
  - Commit: `feat/fix: implement [feature]`
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while tests pass
  - Commit: `refactor: improve [feature] quality`
- **REVIEW Phase**: Spawn specialized subagents; commit findings + retro notes (mandatory)
  - Commit: `review(qa): [task] — PASS` or `review(qa): [task] — FINDING`
  - Commit: `review(ui-ux): [task] — PASS/SKIP`
  - Commit: `review(devops): [task] — PASS`
  - Commit: `review(arch): [task] — PASS/SKIP` *(when structural changes are present)*
  - Commit: `docs: update RETRO_LOG for [task]`
  - See Phase 4 for exact checklist and commit body format.

### Priority 4: Comprehensive Testing (90%+ Coverage MANDATORY)

- **Unit tests**: pytest with pytest-cov (90%+ coverage)
- **Integration tests**: Full workflow tests (`@pytest.mark.integration`)
- **Agent tests**: Mocked Claude API responses (never real API calls in tests)
- **Accessibility tests**: WCAG 2.1 AA validation

### Priority 9: UI/UX (Accessibility MANDATORY - WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **ARIA labels**: All interactive elements
- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab, Enter, Escape
- **Screen reader**: Semantic HTML, proper headings
- **Focus indicators**: Visible on all interactive elements
- **Color contrast**: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text

---

## Autonomous Workflow - THIS IS NOT A GUIDELINE, IT IS A PROCESS

YOU WILL FOLLOW THIS PROCESS IN EVERY COMMIT AND EVERY CONTEXT REFRESH, STEP BY STEP AND VERIFY THAT EVERY SINGLE STEP IS FOLLOWED BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT STEP.

### Phase 0: Re-Contextualize and Review

1. **Contextualize with References**
   - Read `CONSTITUTION.md` (re-contextualization)
   - Read `CLAUDE.md` (project guide)

2. **Review Previous Commit**
   - Check for constitutional violations
   - Check for quality gate violations
   - Check for TDD violations
   - Check for accessibility violations
   - Make sure all acceptance criteria are met

### Phase 1: Task Discovery & Planning

1. **Read Current Phase Backlog** (`docs/backlog/phase-*.md`)
   - Identify next pending task
   - Read task acceptance criteria
   - Read task dependencies

2.  **Plan Approach**
   - Break task into RED-GREEN-REFACTOR steps
   - Identify files to create/modify
   - Identify tests to write
   - Estimate complexity and risks

3. **Suggest Changes for Approval**
   - Present plan to user with:
     - Task summary
     - Files to modify/create
     - Tests to write
     - Estimated commits (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR)
   - Wait for user approval before proceeding
   - Adjust plan based on user feedback

### Phase 2: TDD Development

#### RED Phase (Write Failing Tests)

1. **Create Test File**

   ```bash
   # Example for resume models
   tests/unit/test_models.py
   ```

2. **Write Failing Tests**

   ```python
   """
   Tests for Resume models.

   CONSTITUTION Priority 3: TDD RED Phase
   CONSTITUTION Priority 4: 90%+ Coverage
   """
   import pytest
   from argent.models.resume import Profile, Position


   class TestProfile:
       """Tests for Profile model."""

       def test_profile_full_name(self):
           """Profile computes full_name from first and last name."""
           profile = Profile(
               first_name="Alex",
               last_name="Chen",
               headline="Staff ML Engineer",
           )
           assert profile.full_name == "Alex Chen"

       def test_profile_requires_first_name(self):
           """Profile requires first_name field."""
           with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
               Profile(last_name="Chen", headline="Engineer")
   ```

3. **Run Tests (Verify RED)**

   ```bash
   pytest tests/unit/test_models.py -v
   # Expected: ALL TESTS FAIL - RED PHASE
   ```

4. **Commit RED Phase**

   ```bash
   git add tests/unit/test_models.py
   git commit -m "test(models): add failing tests for Profile model (RED)

   - Write failing tests for full_name computed property
   - Test validation of required fields
   - Test optional fields with defaults

   CONSTITUTION Priority 3: TDD RED Phase"
   ```

#### GREEN Phase (Minimal Implementation)

1. **Create Implementation File**

   ```bash
   src/argent/models/resume.py
   ```

2. **Write Minimal Implementation**

   ```python
   """
   Resume data models.

   CONSTITUTION Priority 3: TDD GREEN Phase
   CONSTITUTION Priority 5: Type hints required
   """
   from pydantic import BaseModel, computed_field


   class Profile(BaseModel):
       """LinkedIn profile data."""

       first_name: str
       last_name: str
       headline: str
       summary: str | None = None
       industry: str | None = None
       location: str | None = None

       @computed_field
       @property
       def full_name(self) -> str:
           """Compute full name from first and last name."""
           return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"
   ```

3. **Run Tests (Verify GREEN)**

   ```bash
   pytest tests/unit/test_models.py -v
   # Expected: ALL TESTS PASS - GREEN PHASE
   ```

4. **Commit GREEN Phase**

   ```bash
   git add src/argent/models/resume.py
   git commit -m "feat(models): implement Profile model (GREEN)

   - Add Profile model with required fields
   - Add computed full_name property
   - Add optional fields with defaults
   - All tests pass

   CONSTITUTION Priority 3: TDD GREEN Phase"
   ```

#### REFACTOR Phase (Improve Quality)

1. **Refactor Implementation**
   - Add docstrings
   - Improve naming
   - Extract common patterns
   - Optimize if needed

2. **Run Tests (Verify STILL GREEN)**

   ```bash
   pytest tests/unit/test_models.py -v
   # Expected: ALL TESTS STILL PASS
   ```

3. **Commit REFACTOR Phase**

   ```bash
   git add src/argent/models/resume.py
   git commit -m "refactor(models): improve Profile model

   - Add comprehensive docstrings
   - Add field descriptions for schema
   - Tests still pass

   CONSTITUTION Priority 3: TDD REFACTOR Phase"
   ```

### Phase 3: Quality Checks (Pre-Merge)

Before moving to self-review, run all quality checks:

1. **Test Coverage**

   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src/argent --cov-fail-under=90
   # Expected: >= 90% coverage
   ```

2. **Linting & Formatting**

   ```bash
   ruff check src/ tests/
   ruff format --check src/ tests/
   # Expected: 0 errors
   ```

3. **Type Checking**

   ```bash
   mypy src/
   # Expected: 0 errors
   ```

4. **Security Scan**

   ```bash
   bandit -c pyproject.toml -r src/
   gitleaks detect --no-git
   # Expected: No issues detected
   ```

5. **Dead Code Scan**

   ```bash
   vulture src/
   # Expected: No output (or only whitelisted items)
   # Advisory: run at 60% for deeper scan (produces Pydantic false positives — review manually)
   vulture src/ --min-confidence 60
   ```

6. **Pre-commit (All Hooks)**
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   # Expected: All hooks pass
   ```

If ANY check fails:

- **STOP immediately**
- Fix the issue
- Re-run all checks
- Do NOT proceed to self-review until all checks pass

### Phase 4: 3-Round Review via Specialized Subagents

**CRITICAL**: This phase delegates each review round to a specialized subagent defined in `.claude/agents/`. Each agent has fresh context and domain expertise — they did NOT implement the code and will surface issues the implementing agent may overlook. Each round still produces a mandatory `review:` commit as verifiable evidence.

#### Why Subagents

The implementing agent knows what was *intended* — reviewers must evaluate what was *actually produced*. Each agent:
- Reads the constitution and project guidelines independently
- Applies domain-specific expertise (QA, accessibility, security)
- Provides a genuinely independent perspective

#### Step 1: Prepare Review Context

Before spawning reviewers, build a context block:

```
## Review Context
Task: <task-id> — <task-name>
Branch: <branch-name>
Changed files:
  <list each changed file with a one-line description>

Summary: <2-3 sentences describing what was implemented and why>

## Git Diff
<output of: git diff main..HEAD>
```

#### Step 2: Spawn Reviewers in Parallel

**In a single message**, invoke reviewers using the Task tool with `subagent_type="general-purpose"`. They run concurrently — no need to wait for one before starting the next.

**Always spawn**: `qa-reviewer`, `ui-ux-reviewer`, `devops-reviewer`

**Also spawn `architecture-reviewer`** when the diff touches any of: `models/`, `agents/`, `parsers/`, `generators/`, `api/`, or any new `.py` file under `src/`. It will self-scope if the change turns out not to be structural.

For each reviewer, prepend the full contents of its agent definition file to the context block:

```
You are acting as the `<agent-name>` specialized agent for this project.
Your full role definition is below.

---
<full contents of .claude/agents/<agent-name>.md, excluding frontmatter>
---

<context block from Step 1>
```

The agent definition files (`.claude/agents/qa-reviewer.md`, etc.) contain the full checklist, bash commands, and output format instructions — include them verbatim so the subagent has complete guidance.

> **Note**: Custom agent names (`qa-reviewer`, `ui-ux-reviewer`, `devops-reviewer`) are defined in `.claude/agents/` and will be directly invocable via `subagent_type` when that feature is available in the running version of Claude Code. Until then, use `general-purpose` with the agent definition embedded in the prompt as described above.

#### Step 3: Process Findings

Read each agent's response. For each finding:

- **PASS / SKIP**: Use the agent's output verbatim in the `review:` commit body.
- **FINDING (fixable)**: Fix the issue, note it as `FINDING (fixed)` in the commit body.
- **FINDING (needs discussion)**: Stop, document the issue, request human input.

**Reset Policy**: If ANY review surfaces an unfixed FINDING that requires code change, fix the code, then **re-run all three reviewers from the beginning** (spawn fresh instances — do not reuse prior results).

**Loop Prevention**: If the same issue recurs across 3+ consecutive review cycles, STOP and request human feedback.

#### Step 4: Create review: Commits

One commit per reviewer, using their full output (including Retrospective Note) as the commit body:

```
review(qa): <task-id> — PASS/FINDING
review(ui-ux): <task-id> — PASS/FINDING/SKIP
review(devops): <task-id> — PASS/FINDING
review(arch): <task-id> — PASS/FINDING/SKIP  ← only when architecture-reviewer was spawned
```

#### Step 5: Update RETRO_LOG

After all review: commits are created, append each agent's Retrospective Note to `docs/RETRO_LOG.md`:

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] <task-id> — <task-name> (PR #<n>)

**QA**: <paste agent's Retrospective Note text>

**UI/UX**: <paste agent's Retrospective Note text>

**DevOps**: <paste agent's Retrospective Note text>

**Architecture** *(if spawned)*: <paste agent's Retrospective Note text>
```

Commit this update as part of the review phase:
```
docs: update RETRO_LOG for <task-id>
```

#### Review Commit Format Reference

**PASS example:**
```
review(qa): P3-T01 QAAgent — PASS

dead-code:              PASS
reachable-handlers:     PASS
exception-specificity:  PASS
silent-failures:        PASS
coverage-gate:          PASS — 96.2%
edge-cases:             PASS
error-paths:            PASS
public-api-coverage:    PASS
meaningful-asserts:     PASS
docstring-accuracy:     PASS
type-annotation-accuracy: PASS

Overall: PASS

## Retrospective Note

<agent's retrospective observation>
```

**FINDING example:**
```
review(devops): P3-T01 QAAgent — FINDING

hardcoded-credentials:     PASS
no-pii-in-code:            PASS
no-auth-material-in-logs:  FINDING — qa_result dict logged at DEBUG includes raw text
                                      Action: wrap log call in pii_filter() [fixed]
input-validation:          PASS
exception-exposure:        PASS
bandit:                    PASS
dependency-audit:          SKIP — no new deps
logging-level-appropriate: PASS
pii-filter-used:           SKIP — no new logging of user content
no-blocking-async:         PASS
structured-logging:        PASS
env-example-updated:       SKIP — no new env vars
no-bypass-flags:           PASS
ci-health:                 PASS
```

**SKIP example (UI/UX on backend-only change):**
```
review(ui-ux): P3-T01 QAAgent — SKIP

SCOPE: SKIP — no template/route/form changes detected.
Files checked: src/argent/templates/, src/argent/static/, src/argent/api/
```

#### Checklist Reference (authoritative copy lives in .claude/agents/)

Each agent's full checklist is in its definition file. For reference:

**QA**: dead-code, reachable-handlers, exception-specificity, silent-failures, edge-cases, error-paths, public-api-coverage, meaningful-asserts, docstring-accuracy, type-annotation-accuracy

**UI/UX**: contrast, focus-indicators, keyboard-nav, skip-links, html-semantic, landmark-regions, form-labels, error-association, required-fields, aria-labels, loading-states, error-messages

**DevOps**: hardcoded-credentials, no-pii-in-code, no-auth-material-in-logs, input-validation, exception-exposure, bandit, logging-level-appropriate, pii-filter-used, no-blocking-async, structured-logging, dependency-audit, env-example-updated, no-bypass-flags, ci-health

**Architecture** *(scope-gated — spawn when diff touches models/, agents/, parsers/, generators/, api/, or new src/ files)*: file-placement, naming-conventions, dependency-direction, no-langchain, async-correctness, abstraction-level, interface-contracts, model-integrity, adr-compliance

### Phase 5: Create Pull Request for User Review

**CRITICAL**: After ALL 3 reviews pass, you MUST create a Pull Request for user review. DO NOT merge directly to main.

After ALL 3 reviews pass:

1. **Create Feature Branch** (if not already on one)

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/P3-T01-qa-agent
   ```

2. **Generate PR Description via Subagent**

   Spawn the `pr-describer` agent (`general-purpose` type, with `.claude/agents/pr-describer.md` content prepended) to draft the PR body:

   ```
   Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="""
   You are acting as the `pr-describer` agent for this project.
   <full contents of .claude/agents/pr-describer.md, excluding frontmatter>
   ---
   Task: <task-id> — <task-name>
   Branch: <branch-name>
   Summary: <what was implemented>
   """)
   ```

   The agent will run `git log main..HEAD` and `git diff main..HEAD --stat` itself to gather full context. Use its output verbatim as the `--body` argument.

3. **Push Branch and Create Pull Request**

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>

   gh pr create \
     --title "<conventional commit type>: <description> (<task-id>)" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <pr-describer output here>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

4. **Wait for User Review**
   - User will review PR and provide feedback
   - Make any requested changes in SAME branch
   - User will merge when approved

5. **After User Merges**
   - Switch back to main: `git checkout main`
   - Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
   - Update backlog to mark task complete
   - Re-contextualize and continue to next task

6. **Re-contextualization After Merge**
   - Read `CONSTITUTION.md`
   - Read `AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md`
   - Continue to next task

---

## Constitutional Amendment Protocol

The process evolves. If a retrospective or self-review reveals a gap in these guidelines, create an amendment commit on the same branch as the work that exposed the gap.

**Amendment commit format:**
```
docs: amend AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT — <what changed and why>
docs: amend CLAUDE.md — <what changed and why>
```

**Amendment commit body:**
```
Amendment trigger: [retrospective | review-finding | new-phase | external-change]
Change: <specific text added, removed, or modified>
Rationale: <why the current guidance was wrong or incomplete>
```

**When to amend:**
- A review finding exposes a gap in the checklist → add the check
- A retrospective identifies a systemic miss → update the relevant round
- A new phase introduces new concerns (e.g., async, web) → extend checklists

**When NOT to amend:**
- A single task was tricky — that's context, not a process flaw
- You're uncertain — document the observation, decide at retrospective

If no amendment is needed, no commit is required. The default is no amendment.

---

## Stopping Conditions

Stop autonomous development and request human intervention if:

1. **Max Consecutive Commits Reached**: 10 commits without user interaction
2. **Test Failure**: Any test fails and cannot be fixed in 3 attempts
3. **Lint/Type Error**: Errors cannot be resolved
4. **Security Issue Detected**: Secrets or PII found
5. **Self-Review Loop Detected**: Same issue fails 3+ times
6. **User Manual Stop**: User explicitly requests stop
7. **Blocker Encountered**: Missing dependency or external blocker
8. **Coverage Drop**: Test coverage falls below 90%
9. **Accessibility Violation**: WCAG 2.1 AA violation cannot be resolved

When stopping, provide:

- Summary of work completed
- Reason for stopping
- Current task status
- Next steps required
- Blockers (if any)

---

## PII Protection Reminder

**NEVER commit these files/directories:**

| Path | Contains | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| `data/` | Real LinkedIn exports | NEVER commit |
| `output/` | Generated resumes | NEVER commit |
| `config.local.json` | User contact info | NEVER commit |
| `.env` | API keys | NEVER commit |
| `logs/` | May contain PII | NEVER commit |

**ALWAYS commit these:**

| Path | Contains | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| `sample_data/` | Fictional test data | Safe to commit |
| `tests/fixtures/` | Fictional test data | Safe to commit |

**Before EVERY commit:**

```bash
git status           # Review what's staged
git diff --cached    # Review actual changes
gitleaks detect      # Verify no secrets
```

## Final Reminder

**ABOVE ALL RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION! IT IS A BINDING CONTRACT.**

- **Priority 0 (Security)** and **Priority 1 (Quality Gates)** are UNBREAKABLE
- **Priority 3 (TDD)** is MANDATORY for ALL code
- **Priority 4 (Testing)** requires 90%+ coverage
- **Priority 9 (Accessibility)** requires WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **PII Protection** is CRITICAL - never commit personal data

**Dual Re-contextualization Protocol**: After EVERY commit and EVERY context refresh, re-read:

1. `CONSTITUTION.md`
2. `AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md`

Failure to follow the CONSTITUTION will result in rejected code and wasted effort.
